/**
  Represents a session which gives access to data stored in a data store.

  A `Session` object can be created from a connection string, from
  `SessionSettings` or by directly specifying a host name, TCP/IP port and user
  credentials. Once created, a session is ready to be used. Session destructor
  closes the session and cleans up after it.

  If it is not possible to create a valid session for some reason, errors
  are thrown from session constructor.

  Several hosts can be specified by session creation parameters. In that case
  a failed connection to one of the hosts triggers a fail-over attempt
  to connect to a different host in the list. Only if none of the hosts could
  be contacted, session creation fails.

  The fail-over logic tries hosts in the order in which they are specified in
  session settings unless explicit priorities are assigned to the hosts. In that
  case hosts are tried in the decreasing priority order and for hosts with
  the same priority the order in which they are tired is random.

  Once a valid session is created using one of the hosts, the session is bound
  to that host and never re-connected again. If the connection gets broken,
  the session fails without making any other fail-over attempts. The fail-over
  logic is executed only when establishing a new session.
